## About
This repository is a collection of projects created at Bellevue University while working toward a Master's in Data Science. This repository includes examples of Python and R code, written reports, and an examplet of a big data pipeline. 

## Work/Projects
List of Portfolio Projects

1.	<a href="Project 1">Identifying Potentially Habitable Exoplanets Using Machine learning: A Broad Overview</a>:  A white paper summarizing research on the role of machine learning in the discovery of potentially habitable exoplanets.

2.	<a href="Project 2">Data Analysis on Nationwide Incarceration Data</a>: Data analysis intended to identify the total nationwide prison population over time and identify any correlation between demographic variables, sentencing, categories of crime, and other variables in order to glean insights into incarceration practices in the United States.

3.	<a href="Project 3">Simple Weather API</a>: A simple Python program to connect to the https://openweathermap.org API. It allows the user to enter a U.S. zip code, city name, or an international city name, then it retrieves the weather information for that location.

4.	<a href="Project 4">Evaluating the Use of Machine Learning to Predict Autism in Children</a>: Deployed a logistic regression model to evaluate whether there are meaningful relationships between variables in the autism screening in children data set.

5.	<a href="Project 5">Evaluating the Use of Machine Learning to Predict Autism in Adults</a>: Deployed logistic regression and random forest models on an adult autism screening data set to evaluate whether it was potentially feasible to create a predictive tool to diagnose autism using machine learning models.

6.	<a href="Project 6">Airline vs. Automobile Safety Infographic & Dashboard</a>: A demonstration of data visualization techniques, using historical airline and automobile safety data, to create a dashboard using PowerBI, as well as an infographic.

7.	<a href="Project 7">Big Data Pipeline</a>: A basic demonstration of a simple big data pipeline using NiFi, HDFS, Hive, and Spark.

8.	<a href="Project 8">NBA Player Performance Metrics and Team Success Analysis</a>: A project evaluating the relationships between key player statistics and team outcomes in the NBA, with the goal of providing actionable insights to stakeholders such as coaches, analysts, and team managers.

9.	<a href="Project 9">NFL Player Performance Metrics and Team Success Analysis</a>: A project evaluating the relationships between key player statistics and team outcomes in the NFL, with the goal of providing actionable insights to stakeholders such as coaches, analysts, and team managers.

10.	<a href="Project 10">MLB Player Performance Metrics and Team Success Analysis</a>: A project evaluating the relationships between key player statistics and team outcomes in MLB, with the goal of providing actionable insights to stakeholders such as coaches, analysts, and team managers.
